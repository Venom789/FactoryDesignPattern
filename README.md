# Factory Design Pattern

The Factory Design Pattern is a creational pattern in software design that provides an interface for creating objects in a super class but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern is used when we have a base class with multiple subclasses and we want to instantiate an object of one of the subclasses based on certain conditions or parameters. This helps in decoupling the client code from the concrete implementations of the objects.




## FAQ

#### Q1: What is the Factory Design Pattern?
A1: The Factory Design Pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a super class but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It promotes loose coupling by separating object creation from the client code.

#### Q2 : What problem does the Factory Design Pattern solve?

A2 : The Factory Design Pattern addresses the problem of creating objects without directly instantiating them in the client code. It allows you to delegate the responsibility of object creation to a factory class, which can decide which concrete subclass to instantiate based on certain conditions.

#### Q3: How does the Factory Design Pattern relate to the Open/Closed Principle?

A3: The Factory Design Pattern relates to the Open/Closed Principle by allowing new subclasses (concrete product implementations) to be added without modifying the existing client code. This is achieved through a factory that produces instances of these new subclasses without changing the client code that uses them.

#### Q4: What are the key components of the Factory Design Pattern?
A4: The key components include:

* Product Interface/Abstract Class: Defines the common interface for all products (subclasses).
* Concrete Products: The subclasses that implement the product interface.
* Factory Interface/Abstract Class: Declares the factory methods for creating products.
* Concrete Factory: Implements the factory methods to create specific product instances.

#### Q5: How is the Factory Design Pattern different from direct object instantiation?
A5: Direct object instantiation involves creating instances of classes using the new keyword in the client code. The Factory Design Pattern abstracts this process by encapsulating it within factory classes. This allows for greater flexibility, easier maintenance, and the ability to vary object creation based on conditions.

#### Q6: What are the advantages of using the Factory Design Pattern?
A6: Some advantages include:

* Enhanced code maintainability and flexibility.
* Reduced coupling between client code and concrete classes.
* Centralized object creation and instantiation logic.
* Simplified adding of new product types without modifying existing code.

#### Q7: Can the Factory Design Pattern be used with dependency injection?
A7: Yes, the Factory Design Pattern can work well with dependency injection. The factory can receive dependencies as constructor parameters and inject them into the created objects, promoting better separation of concerns.

#### Q8: Are there variations of the Factory Design Pattern?
A8: Yes, there are variations such as the Abstract Factory Pattern, which provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects. Additionally, the Simple Factory is a simplified version of the Factory Pattern where a single factory class handles the creation of various product types.

#### Q9: When should I use the Factory Design Pattern?
A9: Use the Factory Design Pattern when you want to decouple object creation from the client code, when you need to create instances of multiple subclasses, and when you anticipate adding new subclasses in the future without modifying existing code.

#### Q10: Are there any potential drawbacks of the Factory Design Pattern?
A10: One potential drawback is the increase in the number of classes, which might seem unnecessary in smaller applications. It can also lead to more complex code if not applied judiciously, so it's important to consider the design and complexity of your application before applying the pattern.
